A personal portfolio website showcasing frontend projects with interactive features such as a project carousel, detailed project articles, and smooth animations.

## Description

This project is a frontend portfolio built with React and Tailwind CSS, designed to showcase recent projects in a clean and interactive way. It features:

- A home page with an introduction and featured projects.
- A dedicated projects page with animated project cards that gently float and zoom on hover.
- A project carousel component with smooth slide animations and swipe support for mobile devices.
- Individual project article pages with reusable layout components showing project details, images, and links.
- Navigation using React Router for seamless page transitions.

The goal is to demonstrate skills in React, responsive design, animations with Framer Motion, and clean component architecture.

You can find highlights of the project like:

- Animated project cards with floating effects.
- Swipe-enabled carousel for recent projects.
- Reusable article layout for project write-ups.
- Integration of external links (live sites, GitHub repos, README files).
- Clipboard copy functionality for easy sharing.
